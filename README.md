Regression Prediction Project

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates machine learning regression techniques to predict continuous numerical outcomes based on tabular datasets. Various regression algorithms are implemented and compared to evaluate their performance and suitability for the dataset.

📊 Dataset

Tabular dataset with numerical features

Target variable: Continuous numeric value (e.g., house prices, sales, etc.)

Data preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling and normalization

Train-test split

⚙️ Preprocessing

Missing values handled using statistical methods (mean/median imputation)

Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler

Dataset split into training and testing sets

🤖 Supervised Learning Models

The following regression algorithms were implemented and compared:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization

Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to explore feature-target relationships

Residual plots to analyze model errors

Comparison charts for model performance

📉 Results & Comparison

Performance of all regression models compared using R² and MSE metrics

Polynomial regression outperformed linear regression on non-linear relationships

Visualization highlights how each model predicts versus actual values

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn
